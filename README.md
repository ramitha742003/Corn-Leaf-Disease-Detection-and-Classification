# Corn Leaf Disease Detection and Classification using CNN and Image Processing

Designed and trained a CNN-based model capable of detecting and classifying multiple corn leaf diseases with high accuracy. 

Evaluated the system’s performance using appropriate metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Implement a Streamlit web application for real-time disease detection from uploaded leaf images.

Tools used: Jupyter notebook, Python, Tensorflow/Keras, Streamlit.
